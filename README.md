# Console-Database
This is my pet project which is console database. It can add, change and delete members of database.

I am currently creating this database for objects similar to participants/persons. In the end, I plan to rewrite the code so that it is more versatile, which will allow the database to be used for many purposes and data types.

At the moment, database stores a Person objects in itself, that has many options to manipulate its info:

**Adding**

**Changing**

**Deleting**

**Finding**

**Showing**
